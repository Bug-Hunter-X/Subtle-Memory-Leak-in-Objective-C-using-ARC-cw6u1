The solution is straightforward: ensure you always release or set to `nil` strong properties when they are no longer needed before a method exits, especially if that exit isn't the method's normal completion path. 

Here's the corrected code:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
    // ... some code ...
    self.myString = nil; // Added this line for memory management
}
@end
```

Alternatively, if the object's lifecycle is tied to the object's lifetime, you could use a `weak` property instead to avoid this entirely. This is appropriate if `myString` doesn't need to keep the string alive beyond the life cycle of the `MyClass` object. However, it depends on the intended usage of your objects.
