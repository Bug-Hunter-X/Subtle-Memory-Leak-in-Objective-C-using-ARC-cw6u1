In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
    // ... some code ...
}
@end
```

The issue lies in scenarios where `someMethod` might be prematurely exited (e.g., due to an exception or early return).  If `self.myString` is not properly nilled out before exiting `someMethod`, the `myString` will retain a strong reference to the `NSString` instance, preventing it from being deallocated. This leads to memory leaks that accumulate over time.

This problem is particularly insidious because it doesn't immediately manifest as a crash, but instead as gradual memory consumption. Debugging such leaks requires meticulous use of Instruments or other memory profiling tools.
